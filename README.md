## Problem Statement

Clinical studies often require detailed patientsâ€™ information documented in clinical narratives. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task to extract entities of interest (e.g., disease names, medication names and lab tests) from clinical narratives, thus to support clinical and translational research.** Clinical notes have been analyzed in greater detail to harness important information for clinical research and other healthcare operations, as they depict rich, detailed medical information.


In this challenge, hackers are invited to extract all disease names from a given set of 20000 paragraphs/documents in the test set provided the labelled entities (diseases) for 30000 documents in the train set.

For example, here is a sentence from a clinical report:

*We compared the inter-day reproducibility of post-occlusive **reactive hyperemia** (PORH) assessed by single-point laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and laser speckle contrast analysis (LSCI).*


In the sentence given, **reactive hyperemia (in bold)** is the named entity with the type disease/indication.

 

## Data Description
The train file has the following structure:
 
|Variable | Definition|
|---|---|
|id|	Unique ID for a token/word|
|Doc_ID	|Unique ID for a Document/Paragraph|
|Sent_ID|	Unique ID for a Sentence|
|Word	|Exact word/token|
|tag	(Target)| Named Entity Tag  |

The target 'tag' follows the **Inside-outside-beginning (IOB)** tagging format. The IOB format (short for inside, outside, beginning) is a common tagging format for tagging tokens in named-entity recognition.

**The B-indications (beginning) tag indicates that the token is the beginning of a disease entity (disease name in this case)
An I-indications (inside) tag indicates that the token is inside an entity
An O (outside) tag indicates that a token is outside a disease entity**


# Approach

* Tried NB with simple TF-ID features which gave ~58.XX
* Used sklearn crf_suite and F1 score increased to ~75 and tried to build some more features which resulted in melt down, finally optimized parameters

# Leaderboard

* **[Public LB](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/innoplexus-online-hiring-hackathon-saving-lives-wi/lb)** : **16th Rank**
* **[Private LB](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/innoplexus-online-hiring-hackathon-saving-lives-wi/pvt_lb)** : **22th Rank**


# Conclusion
* Generating new features other than pos_tag didnt work, tried introducing length and 2-3 more features for which i lost score
* Training and predicting time took a lot of toll :D
